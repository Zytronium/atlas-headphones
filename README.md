# Designer Language - Validate

In this project, we recreate a specific web page from scratch without using any
libraries. We will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design skills that
we previously learned. This will be done without much of instruction. The goal
is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer
file on Figma, which can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/FfnVADRC9xgI3yiZliTBYZ/Holberton-School---Headphone-company?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=flRs5nrNmJX9IxOc-0).

### Tasks checklist:
[//]: # ("​" comes before every number because otherwise, the
numbers will be formatted like "i, ii, iii, iv, etc." instead
of "1, 2, 3, 4, etc.". "​" is a zero-width space)
